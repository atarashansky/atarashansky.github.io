## iNoodl

I built iNoodl because I couldn't find any other applications that were capable of effortlessly capturing the ideas my ADHD brain would randomly pull from the ether. I have been using this app religiously since its creation. I hope it helps you as much as it has helped me.

I'm very responsive to feature requests. In fact, I don't know what I would do without them. Please request features.
