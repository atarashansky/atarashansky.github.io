## Bio

I was a Stanford Graduate Fellow and Bio-X Fellow in the Bioengineering PhD program at Stanford University. I am passionate about anything computational.

During my PhD, I developed numerous algorithms for the analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data. Specifically, I developed the first generalizable algorithm for mapping single-cell datasets across species. Now, it is possible to compare vastly different organisms to learn about how their cell types have diverged during evolution (https://elifesciences.org/articles/66747).

I am continuing this line of work as a Data Scientist at Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. In addition to the quantitative cell sciences, I have honed my skills as a full-stack software engineer in developing a web browser interface for interactively exploring and analyzing single-cell data (https://github.com/czbiohub/excellxgene).

My other interests include blockchain development, rock climbing (I suppose I'm your typical Bay-Area-boulder-bro), and sci-fi.
